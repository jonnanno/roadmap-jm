------------

1.- [Single-Page CV](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv)

Create a single-page HTML CV to showcase your career history.

*The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. You will focus on laying out your education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. Styling will be addressed in a later project.*

2.-[Basic HTML website](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website)

Create simple HTML only website with multiple pages.

*Goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML i.e. different sections of a website like header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars etc. Do not style the website, only focus on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.*

3.- [Personal Portfolio](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website)

Convert the previous simple HTML website into a personal portfolio.

*The goal of this project is to teach you how to style a website using CSS. You will take the structure from the [previous HTML-only project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website) and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.*
